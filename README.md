# Predicting Systolic Blood Pressure Case-Study

Systolic blood pressure is a medical measure that indicates how much pressure blood is exerting against
artery walls when the heart beats. The measure is considered as a major risk factor for cardiovascular
disease for people over fifty-five years old (American Heart Association, 2023). There may be numerous
internal and external factors influencing the volume or level of systolic blood pressure. From our analysis,
we have found these significant factors: smoking status, exercise level, height, alcohol use, treatment status,
body mass index (BMI), interaction between smoke status and alcohol, and interaction between treatment
and BMI.
This case study aims to better understand the relationship between various factors and the blood pressure
by speculating and analyzing possible key predicting factors.
The research question is: What Factors Play Significant Role in Influencing Systolic Blood Pressure?
